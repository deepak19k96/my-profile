    "bio": "My name is Deepak Kumar and I am a graduate of Computer Science with 5 years of professional Software development (Fullstack) experience. I came across your job posting here on Stackoverflow and I am happy to express my interest to the open fullstack engineer position. Since I've started my professional career back in 2015 I've already been doing fullstack development with different technologies that were mostly built in PHP and Javascript. This includes experience with different MVC frameworks like Laravel and Codeigniter, yii, as well Wordpress experience. On top of that, I also have experience working with Hybrid Apps and SPAs using Angular, Ionic and React. As far as other languages are concerned, I do have some short but valuable experience with ASP.NET, Java and(C#) as well.",
